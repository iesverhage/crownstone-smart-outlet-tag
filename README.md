# License
Crownstone provides the designs in this repository under a dual license model.

- For Manufacturers, OEMs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Products or Applications

Manufacturers, OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors of commercial products or applications that use or distribute the electronic designs, layouts, or other electronic derivatives in this repository and do not wish to distribute their designs, adjustments, under the CERN-OHL-W 2.0 license (see below) must enter into a commercial license agreement with Crownstone.

- For Open-Source Products, Projects, or Developers of Open-Source Products or Applications

For developers who are willing to distribute under the CERN-OHL-W 2.0 license (see  https://spdx.org/licenses/CERN-OHL-W-2.0.html) which is a weakly reciprocal license, we offer this license. In an informal nutshell: (a) the term "reciprocal" means that if any product is made using this hardware design, the design of that product, including any improvements or modifications, should be made available under the same licence, (b) the term "weakly" means that the product can be used as a part in a larger design and that larger design doesn't need to be made available under the same license. Inspect the license text for the exact conditions.
